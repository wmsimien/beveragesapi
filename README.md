## Usage
Using an API platform like Postman, as a registered user, you can call all operational endpoints of the Family Time Beverage API (FTBA) which are available on port 9092.  An unregistered user can only access the register and login endpoints as follows:

### #2 To Creaste a New User (Register):
```
localhost:9092/auth/users/register/

{
    "userName" : "jane",
    "email": "jane@aol.com",
    "password": "jane"
}
```
### #3 To Login As a Registered User:
```
localhost:9092/auth/users/login/

{
    "email":"jane@aol.com",
    "password":"jane"
}
```

Once the registered user logs in, a JWT will be returned which will be needed to access all the other endpoints.  The JWT will need to be added to every request/endpoint headers section with 'Authorization' as a Key and the Value will need to be Bear [JWT] as follows:
![Postman Headers](./src/main/resources/assets/postman_headers.png)

### #4 Create A Beverage Type
```
POST localhost:9092/api/beverage-type/
{
    "name":"MaeMae-Tea Drinks"
    
}

RESPONSE 200 OK
{
    "id": 29,
    "name": "MaeMae-Tea Drinks",
    "beverageList": null
}
```

### #5 Listing of All Beverage Types
```
GET localhost:9092/api/beverage-type/

RESPONSE 200 OK

        "id": 29,
        "name": "MaeMae-Tea Drinks",
        "beverageList": []
    }
